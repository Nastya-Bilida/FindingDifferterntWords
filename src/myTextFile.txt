You can tell by the way
She walks that she's my girl
You can tell by the way
She talks, she rules the world
You can see in her eyes
That no one is her chain
She's my girl
My supergirl
And then she'd say
It's okay
I got lost
On the way but I'm a supergirl
And supergirls don't cry
And then she'd say
It's alright
I got home
Late last night, but I'm a supergirl
And supergirls just fly
